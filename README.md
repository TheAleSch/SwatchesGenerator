# 🎨 SwatchesGenerator – Build Smarter, More Accessible Color Themes

**SwatchesGenerator** is an experimental theming tool built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Chroma.js**, designed to help teams create perceptually uniform, accessible color palettes from a single hue input.

Originally developed as part of a smarter theming system initiative in a Appcues hackathon, the tool explores how modern color spaces like **OKLCH** and **LAB** can improve contrast consistency, accessibility, and brand alignment across UI components.


## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Contrast-aware palette generation** using `oklch()` notation and perceptual color spaces  
- ⚙️ **Dynamic CSS token output** (via JS) to streamline theme creation  
- 🧪 **Chroma.js fallback** for CSS compatibility across all browsers  
- 🌈 Real-time hue input with shade generation across a luminance range  
- 📐 Future extensibility for density, border radius, and more design tokens  

## 💡 Why This Exists

Traditional HSL-based theming systems often fail to provide consistent visual contrast across hues. This tool was born from the need to:

- Create **accessible and consistent themes** from minimal input  
- Improve **speed and flexibility** for non-technical users  
- Prototype and validate ideas for **future theming systems** at scale
